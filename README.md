# Christmas Arkanoid
A patch on Arkanoid to create Christmas themed levels!

The patch file is to be run against the 'arkatayt' romset in MAME.
You can run a non-offical ROM in MAME via the commandline.
Alternatively, other versions of MAME exist that do not validate checksums.

## Create Christmas Version of Arkaniod from Pach file
- Download arkatayt.zip from a trusted source
- Unzip it to a local directory
- Copy 'arkatayt_christmas.patch' to that directory
- Run 'git apply arkatayt_christmas.patch' from  the commandline
- Re-zip the directory and move to a location MAME can read (your MAME roms directory)
- Run the game with MAME via the commandline with a Ho-Ho-Ho!
