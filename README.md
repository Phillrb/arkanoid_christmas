# Christmas Arkanoid
A patch on Arkanoid to create Christmas themed levels!

The patch file is to be run against the 'arkatayt' romset in MAME.
You can run a non-offical ROM in MAME via debug mode by passing the '-debug' flag.
Alternatively, other versions of MAME exist that do not validate checksums.

- Download arkatayt.zip from a trusted source
- Unzip it to a directory
- Copy 'arkatayt_christmas.patch' to that directory
- Run 'git apply arkatayt_christmas.patch'
- Re-zip the directory
- Run the game with MAME in debug mode with a Ho-Ho-Ho!
