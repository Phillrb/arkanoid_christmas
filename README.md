# Christmas Arkanoid
A patch on Arkanoid to create Christmas themed levels!

[<img src="./level_1.png" width="250" />](./level_1.png) 

The patch file is to be run against the 'arkatayt' romset in MAME.
You can run a non-offical ROM in MAME via the commandline.
Alternatively, other versions of MAME exist that do not validate checksums.

## Create Christmas Version of Arkaniod from Pach file
- Download arkatayt.zip from a trusted source
- Unzip it to a local directory
- Copy 'arkatayt_christmas.patch' to that directory
- Run 'git apply arkatayt_christmas.patch' from  the commandline
- Re-zip the directory and move to a location MAME can read (your MAME roms directory)
- Run the game with MAME via the commandline with a Ho-Ho-Ho!

## How was this made?
[ArkEdit](https://arcarc.xmission.com/Kits%20and%20Hacks/Arkanoid%20Editor/arkedit.html) was used by my daughter (aged 14) to create all the levels!

## Try on Real Hardware
This can be put on a real Arkanoid PCB using the [Arkanoid Multi](https://github.com/Phillrb/arkanoid_multi)
